# Joint_Account_Solidity
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/880/1*KhxTw-tTuNN8hhmbF3uzVw.png)

This project consists of a smart contract that automates the creation of joint savings accounts and allows the execution of basic financial processes in an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

The Solidity smart contract accepts two user addresses that will be able to control the joint savings account, and uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for joint savings account features -- the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

The contract was tested in the Remix JavaScript VM.
